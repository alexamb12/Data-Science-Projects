# Data Science Projects

## Overview: 
This repository holds all my completed Data Science projects. 

The projects I find are from sources suchs as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDbYWbpE4MFEODQaSlVeQaY7Q5NlQUVXA), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), etc. or projects I create on my own.

**Note:** For information on each project, please see the **README.md** file that can be found in each project folder.
