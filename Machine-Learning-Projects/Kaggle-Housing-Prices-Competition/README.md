 # Kaggle Housing Prices Competion | Machine Learning Project
 
This project was a part of Kaggle's [Intro To Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) course. I utilized Python libraries such as `pandas` and `scikit-learn`. After completion of this project, we were to submit it to the **Housing Prices Competition**. Below is the description (from Kaggle) of the competition.

# Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Project File
The project can be found in the `Kaggle-Housing-Prices-Competition.ipynb` jupyter notebook. I provide detailed explanations for my approach to the tasks and definitions for the terms used.

## Setup 
Installing Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html <br/>
Installing Pandas library: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html <br/>
Installing Sci-kit Learn Library: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html <br/>
# Overview
This project provides a set of training data (`train.csv`) and data we will test our model on (`test.csv`). There is a `datadescription.txt` file that defines what all the variables in the data represent. I focus on these general steps:

* building a model
* fitting the model
* making predictions
* validating the model 

The main two models that are taught in this course are the **Decision Tree** and the **Random Forest** model. The project also goes into the importance of splitting the data and how to avoid underfitting or overfitting the model.

# Feedback
Any feedback or suggestions on how to make this project better are always welcomed. Feel free to send a pull request or contact me via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/alexatech_/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandriabaldizon/).

**Note** As I go further along in the Kaggle courses, I will make changes to this project to improve my model and boost my way up the leaderboard!
