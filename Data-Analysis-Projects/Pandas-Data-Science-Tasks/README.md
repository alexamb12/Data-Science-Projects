# Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks
This project was provided by [Keith Galli](https://www.instagram.com/keithgalli/) from his YouTube video, [Solving Real World Data Science Tasks with Python Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4&t=4454s). I worked on this project on my own and referrenced his video for any guidance when neccessary. 

The jupyter notebook ` Analysis-of-Sales-Data.ipynb` goes into a step-by-step analysis for approaching each question and the thought process on why each question was approached that way.

**Project File:** `Analysis-of-Sales-Data.ipynb`

## Overview

This project focuses on completing a set of real world data science tasks using the Python Pandas library. We also utilize the Python Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize our data. The data consists of 12 `.csv` files, that correspond to each month of the year, filled with order information of tech gear and electronics.

## Setup

Installing Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html <br/>
Installing Pandas library: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html 

## Tasks 


Before answering the questions below, we will use Pandas to clean our data of any missing values and make sure everything is in the correct format that is suitable for analysis.

These are common data science questions that are asked amongst business to gain more insight about their products and how to improve production:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
